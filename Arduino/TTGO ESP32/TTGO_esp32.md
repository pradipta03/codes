# TTGO ESP32

- Includes all my code with Lilygo esp32 board.
  - Currently there are may boards from Lilygo.
  - But  I am using mainly two of the following boards.
    - ![[Lilygo_ESP32 T-display 1.14 inch.png]]
    - ![[LILYGO T-Display-S3 ESP32-S3 1.9 inch.jpg]]

- Personally I think these boards have a vibrant screen which makes it as an ideal board for prototyping and debugging.
