# TTGO ESP32

- Includes all my code with Lilygo esp32 board.
  - Currently there are may boards from Lilygo.
  - But  I am using mainly two of the following boards.
    - ![Lilygo T-Display ESP32 1.14 inch](ESP32_114_inch.jpg)
    - ![LILYGO T-Display-S3 ESP32-S3 1.9 inch](ESP32_19_inch.jpg)

- Personally I think these boards have a vibrant screen which makes it versatile and an ideal board for prototyping and debugging.
